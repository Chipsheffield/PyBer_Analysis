# PyBer_Analysis
Module5
##
## Overview of the analysis: 
### *Explain the purpose of the new analysis.*
#### The purpose of the analysis is to provide the rideshare company PyBer with a data analysis on recent data acquired in the form of 2 CSV files. The purpose is to create DataFrames and graphs that will show relationship between the type of city, and the number of drivers and riders, and total and percent of fares by city type. This analysis will be used to help PyBer determine access and increase affordability in underserved neighborhoods as part of a future presentation. 
#### Pedologically it is to introduce us to creating various DataFrames and graphs using Matplotlib and Pandas. 
## 
## Results:
### *Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.* 
#### Below is the ride-sharing data we recently obtained concentrating on Urban, Suburban, and Rural city/location types.

####
#### Looking at the above we can see that among the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type, there is a definite difference between the three. And as shown below, that difference isnâ€™t time dependent.

#### 
#### Also, although the Average Fare for both Ride and Driver in Urban City environments may be the lowest, they make up the bulk of our Fares at 62.7%.

#### The opposite can be said of Rural environments. Although being the most profitable in terms of Average Fare for both Ride and Driver, because of the small number of Rides, they generate the smallest percentage of Total Fares. With Suburban environments at times being almost the mean of the two.   

#### 
## 
## Summary: 
### *Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.* 
#### 
* With Urban environments composing 67% of our Fares, and having the largest number of Rides and Drivers, it may improve our Total Fares by increasing the Total Rides since the data shows there were more Total Drivers than Total Rides. 
* With Rural environments composing 6.8% of our Fares, and having the smallest number of Rides and Drivers, it may improve our Total Fares by increasing the Total Rides since they have the highest Average Fare per Ride.
* With Rural environments composing 6.8% of our Fares, and having the smallest number of Rides and Drivers, it may improve our Total Fares by increasing the Total Drivers since they have the highest Average Fare per Driver.
